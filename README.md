UI:

Define cameras (camera id, name)
Manually control notify for each/all cameras
Configure notification outputs (don't tie it to discord, but only start with discord)
Set up cron schedules for automatically turning on/off notifying (multiple cameras)?

Backend:

Scan target directory for new "alarm.jpg"
Trigger appropriate event handler if one detected
Respond to UI events appropriately
